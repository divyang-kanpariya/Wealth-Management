# Dropdown Positioning Fix Requirements

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical UI/UX issue where action dropdown menus (three-dot buttons) are getting hidden behind or under table elements when there's only one row of data. This makes the action buttons inaccessible to users, significantly impacting usability across all data tables in the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dropdown Visibility Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want dropdown menus to always be visible when opened, so that I can access all available actions regardless of table size or row count.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dropdown menu is opened THEN the system SHALL detect if the dropdown would be clipped by container boundaries
2. WHEN the dropdown extends beyond the viewport THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust its position
3. WHEN there's insufficient space below THEN the system SHALL position the dropdown above the trigger button
4. IF there's insufficient space on both sides THEN the system SHALL use the position with maximum visibility
5. WHEN the dropdown is repositioned THEN the system SHALL maintain proper alignment with the trigger button

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Positioning Logic

**User Story:** As a user, I want dropdown menus to intelligently position themselves, so that they're always fully accessible regardless of their location on the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating dropdown position THEN the system SHALL consider viewport boundaries, container overflow, and scroll position
2. WHEN positioning dropdowns THEN the system SHALL prefer bottom-right alignment but adjust based on available space
3. WHEN space is limited horizontally THEN the system SHALL flip the dropdown to the left side of the trigger
4. IF the dropdown is near the bottom edge THEN the system SHALL position it above the trigger button
5. WHEN multiple positioning conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL choose the position that maximizes visible dropdown area

### Requirement 3: Table-Specific Dropdown Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want action dropdowns in tables to work consistently, so that I can perform actions on any row regardless of table size or scroll position.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a table has only one row THEN the dropdown SHALL still be fully visible and accessible
2. WHEN a table is inside a scrollable container THEN the dropdown SHALL position relative to the viewport, not the container
3. WHEN a table row is near container edges THEN the dropdown SHALL adjust its position to remain visible
4. IF a table has horizontal scroll THEN the dropdown SHALL account for scroll position in its positioning
5. WHEN the table is resized or scrolled THEN open dropdowns SHALL reposition themselves accordingly

### Requirement 4: Z-Index and Layering Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want dropdown menus to appear above all other content, so that they're never hidden behind other UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dropdown is opened THEN it SHALL have a higher z-index than all table and container elements
2. WHEN multiple dropdowns could be open THEN the most recently opened SHALL have the highest z-index
3. WHEN dropdowns overlap with modals or other overlays THEN the system SHALL manage z-index hierarchy appropriately
4. IF there are z-index conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them with a consistent layering strategy
5. WHEN a dropdown is closed THEN its z-index SHALL be reset to prevent stacking context issues

### Requirement 5: Responsive Dropdown Behavior

**User Story:** As a user, I want dropdown menus to work properly on all screen sizes, so that I can access actions on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application on mobile devices THEN dropdowns SHALL position themselves to avoid being cut off by screen edges
2. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN open dropdowns SHALL reposition themselves appropriately
3. WHEN the viewport is very small THEN dropdowns SHALL use alternative positioning strategies (e.g., center-aligned)
4. IF touch interactions are detected THEN the system SHALL optimize dropdown positioning for touch targets
5. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN dropdown positioning SHALL not interfere with focus management

### Requirement 6: Performance and Smooth Transitions

**User Story:** As a user, I want dropdown positioning to be fast and smooth, so that the interface feels responsive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dropdown opens THEN the positioning calculation SHALL complete within 16ms to maintain 60fps
2. WHEN repositioning occurs THEN the system SHALL use smooth CSS transitions to avoid jarring movements
3. WHEN multiple position calculations are needed THEN the system SHALL debounce calculations to prevent performance issues
4. IF positioning calculations are expensive THEN the system SHALL cache results when possible
5. WHEN dropdowns are frequently opened/closed THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance without memory leaks
