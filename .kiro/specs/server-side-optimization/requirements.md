# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current personal wealth management application renders pages on the frontend by making multiple API calls and processing data client-side. This causes slower page loads and unnecessary complexity. This feature will convert pages to be statically served from the backend with all data pre-processed and ready for display, eliminating the need for frontend data fetching and processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want pages to load instantly with all data already available, so that I don't have to wait for multiple API calls and data processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page THEN the page SHALL be served statically from the backend with all data pre-loaded
2. WHEN a page loads THEN it SHALL not make any API calls for initial data display
3. WHEN data needs to be displayed THEN it SHALL already be processed and formatted on the server
4. WHEN charts and analytics are shown THEN the data SHALL be pre-calculated and ready for immediate rendering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate frontend data fetching and processing, so that pages are simpler and faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are rendered THEN they SHALL use Next.js server-side rendering or static generation instead of client-side data fetching
2. WHEN data processing is needed THEN it SHALL happen on the server before the page is served
3. WHEN multiple API calls are currently made THEN they SHALL be consolidated into server-side data preparation
4. WHEN calculations are required THEN they SHALL be performed on the server and included in the static page data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work without loading states and spinners, so that the experience feels instant and smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page loads THEN it SHALL display complete content immediately without loading states
2. WHEN data is shown THEN it SHALL be instantly visible without progressive loading
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN pages SHALL load with full content pre-rendered
4. WHEN interactive elements are needed THEN only user interactions SHALL remain client-side
