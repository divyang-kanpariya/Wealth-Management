# UI Component Modernization Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

Convert the UI component modernization design into a series of actionable coding tasks that will systematically audit, replace, and clean up UI components to create a consistent modern design system.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] 1. Component Discovery and Audit




  - Scan all component files in src/components/ directory
  - Identify all UI components and their usage patterns
  - Categorize components as new, legacy, core, or unused
  - Create comprehensive component inventory with usage statistics
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_





- [x] 2. Create Component Migration Mapping







  - Define mapping between legacy components and new compact components
  - Document prop transformations needed for each migration



  - Identify breaking changes and required code updates
  - Create migration complexity assessment for each component
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Audit and Standardize Core UI Components








  - Review existing Modal, Button, and Form components
  - Ensure they follow the new design system patterns
  - Update any inconsistent styling or behavior
  - Verify TypeScript types are properly defined
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4, 5.4_

- [x] 4. Replace Legacy Card Components with CompactCard







  - Find all usage of old Card, InfoCard, SummaryCard components
  - Replace with CompactCard using appropriate variants
  - Update props to match CompactCard API
  - Test functionality and visual consistency
  --_Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 5. Replace Legacy Action Components with QuickActions






















- [ ] 5. Replace Legacy Action Components with QuickActions

  - Find all usage of old ButtonGroup, ActionButtons, ToolbarActions
  - Replace with QuickActions component
  - Transform button arrays to actions array format
  - Update event handlers and prop structures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 6. Replace Legacy Data Display with DataGrid





  - Find all usage of StatsGrid, MetricsDisplay, SummaryStats
  - Replace with DataGrid component
  - Transform data structures to DataGridItem format
  - Update styling and layout configurations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 7. Standardize Loading and Error States





  - Replace all custom loading spinners with LoadingState
  - Replace inconsistent error displays with ErrorState
  - Replace ad-hoc notifications with Alert component
  - Ensure consistent messaging and styling
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 8. Update Component Imports and Exports





  - Standardize all UI component imports to use consistent patterns
  - Update barrel exports in src/components/ui/index.ts
  - Remove exports for deleted legacy components
  - Ensure all new components are properly exported
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 9. Remove Unused Legacy Components





  - Identify components with zero usage after replacements
  - Delete unused component files and their associated tests
  - Clean up any remaining imports or references
  - Update documentation that references removed components
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 10. Fix TypeScript Errors and Type Issues









  - Resolve any TypeScript errors from component migrations
  - Update component prop types to match new APIs
  - Fix type imports and exports
  - Ensure strict type checking passes
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 5.4_

- [x] 11. Validate Component Functionality









  - Test all pages render correctly with new components
  - Verify interactive elements work as expected
  - Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
  - Ensure accessibility standards are maintained
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5_



- [-] 12. Create Component Usage Documentation



  - Document all available compact components and their props
  - Provide code examples for each component
  - Create best practices guide for component usage
  - Document migration patterns for future reference
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

## Task Dependencies

- Task 1 must be completed before all other tasks (discovery phase)
- Task 2 depends on Task 1 (need audit results to create mapping)
- Tasks 4-7 can be done in parallel after Task 2 (component replacements)
- Task 8 should be done after Tasks 4-7 (clean up imports after replacements)
- Task 9 depends on Tasks 4-8 (remove unused after all replacements)
- Task 10 should be done continuously during Tasks 4-9 (fix types as we go)
- Task 11 depends on Tasks 4-10 (validate after all changes)
- Task 12 can be done in parallel with later tasks (document as we build)

## Success Criteria

- All legacy UI components are replaced with modern compact components
- No unused component files remain in the codebase
- All imports and exports are standardized and consistent
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- All pages render correctly with consistent design
- Component usage is properly documented
- Performance and accessibility are maintained or improved
