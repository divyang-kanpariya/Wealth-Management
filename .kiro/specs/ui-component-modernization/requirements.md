# UI Component Modernization Requirements

## Introduction

This feature focuses on modernizing and standardizing the UI components across the personal wealth management application. We have successfully implemented a new compact design system with components like CompactCard, QuickActions, DataGrid, etc. Now we need to systematically replace old UI components with the new ones and remove unused legacy components to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Audit and Inventory

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have a complete inventory of all UI components, so that I can identify which components need to be modernized or removed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting a component audit THEN the system SHALL identify all existing UI components in the codebase
2. WHEN analyzing component usage THEN the system SHALL categorize components as: actively used, legacy/old, or unused
3. WHEN documenting components THEN the system SHALL list the new compact components and their old equivalents
4. IF a component has both old and new versions THEN the system SHALL identify which pages/components are using which version

### Requirement 2: Legacy Component Replacement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace old UI components with new compact components, so that the application has a consistent modern design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing components THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality while using the new design
2. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL replace old component imports with new compact component imports
3. WHEN modifying props THEN the system SHALL map old component props to new component props appropriately
4. IF a component has breaking changes THEN the system SHALL update the usage patterns accordingly
5. WHEN replacing components THEN the system SHALL ensure no visual or functional regressions occur

### Requirement 3: Unused Component Removal

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused legacy components, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying unused components THEN the system SHALL verify no imports or references exist
2. WHEN removing components THEN the system SHALL delete the component files and their associated tests
3. WHEN cleaning up exports THEN the system SHALL remove unused exports from index files
4. IF a component is partially used THEN the system SHALL replace usage before removal
5. WHEN removing components THEN the system SHALL update any documentation that references them

### Requirement 4: Import and Export Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized imports and exports for UI components, so that component usage is consistent across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL use consistent import patterns for UI components
2. WHEN organizing exports THEN the system SHALL ensure all new components are properly exported from index files
3. WHEN removing old exports THEN the system SHALL clean up unused exports from barrel files
4. IF there are naming conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them with appropriate naming conventions
5. WHEN standardizing imports THEN the system SHALL prefer named imports over default imports where appropriate

### Requirement 5: Component Usage Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that all component replacements work correctly, so that the application functions properly after modernization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing components THEN the system SHALL verify all pages render correctly
2. WHEN testing functionality THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements work as expected
3. WHEN checking responsive design THEN the system SHALL verify components work on all screen sizes
4. IF there are TypeScript errors THEN the system SHALL resolve type mismatches from component changes
5. WHEN validating accessibility THEN the system SHALL ensure new components maintain accessibility standards

### Requirement 6: Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated documentation for the new component system, so that future development uses the correct components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL document all available compact components and their usage
2. WHEN providing examples THEN the system SHALL include code examples for each component
3. WHEN documenting props THEN the system SHALL list all available props and their types
4. IF components have specific usage patterns THEN the system SHALL document best practices
5. WHEN creating migration guides THEN the system SHALL provide guidance for future component updates
