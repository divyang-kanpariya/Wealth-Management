# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current personal wealth management application has caching issues that prevent real-time updates from being reflected immediately after CRUD operations. Additionally, external API calls for pricing data are slow and inefficient. This feature will implement a dynamic caching strategy that ensures immediate reflection of data changes while optimizing external API usage through strategic local caching and refresh mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data changes to be reflected immediately after creating, updating, or deleting records, so that I can see the current state of my data without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new investment, goal, SIP, or account THEN the updated data SHALL be visible immediately without manual page refresh
2. WHEN a user updates existing data THEN the changes SHALL be reflected instantly across all relevant pages and components
3. WHEN a user deletes a record THEN it SHALL disappear from all views immediately
4. WHEN CRUD operations are performed THEN the system SHALL bypass cache and fetch fresh data from the database
5. WHEN a user navigates between pages after data changes THEN all pages SHALL show the most current data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want pricing data to load quickly without waiting for slow external API calls, so that I can view my portfolio performance efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pricing data is requested THEN it SHALL be served from local database cache instead of external APIs
2. WHEN external APIs are called THEN it SHALL happen at regular intervals (every 1 hour) in the background
3. WHEN pricing data is updated from external APIs THEN it SHALL be stored in the local database for future requests
4. WHEN the system fetches pricing data THEN it SHALL handle API failures gracefully with fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN users view portfolio data THEN pricing information SHALL load instantly from cached database values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually refresh pricing data when needed, so that I can get the most current market prices on demand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a refresh button on any page with pricing data THEN the system SHALL fetch real-time data from external APIs
2. WHEN real-time pricing data is fetched THEN it SHALL update the local database immediately
3. WHEN pricing data is refreshed THEN the updated values SHALL be reflected on the page instantly
4. WHEN a refresh operation fails THEN the user SHALL be notified with appropriate error messaging
5. WHEN multiple users trigger refresh simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to maintain data consistency and performance, so that users have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system determines data freshness THEN it SHALL distinguish between dynamic user data and external pricing data
2. WHEN caching strategies are applied THEN user-generated data SHALL always be fresh while pricing data SHALL be cached appropriately
3. WHEN external API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL use cached data and retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL be optimized to handle both real-time user data and cached pricing data efficiently
5. WHEN system performance is measured THEN page load times SHALL be improved while maintaining data accuracy
