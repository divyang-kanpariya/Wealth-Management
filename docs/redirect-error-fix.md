# Fix for NEXT_REDIRECT Error

## Problem
Users were seeing `NEXT_REDIRECT` errors in the console when performing CRUD operations like deleting investments. The error looked like:

```
Error deleting investment: Error: NEXT_REDIRECT
at getRedirectError (..\..\..\src\client\components\redirect.ts:21:16)
at redirect (..\..\..\src\client\components\redirect.ts:47:8)
at deleteInvestment (src\lib\server\actions\investments.ts:218:13)
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by using `redirect()` calls inside server actions. In Next.js, `redirect()` throws a special error that's meant to be caught by the framework's routing system, but this error was being logged as an actual error, causing confusion.

## Solution
**Removed all `redirect()` calls from server actions** and restored proper return statements.

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
export async function deleteInvestment(id: string): Promise<InvestmentActionResult> {
  try {
    await prisma.investment.delete({ where: { id } })
    
    CacheInvalidation.invalidateInvestments()
    CacheInvalidation.invalidateDashboard()
    
    // This was causing the NEXT_REDIRECT error
    redirect('/investments')
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
export async function deleteInvestment(id: string): Promise<InvestmentActionResult> {
  try {
    await prisma.investment.delete({ where: { id } })
    
    CacheInvalidation.invalidateInvestments()
    CacheInvalidation.invalidateDashboard()
    
    // Proper return statement
    return {
      success: true
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Failed to delete investment'
    }
  }
}
```

## Fixed Actions
All investment server actions now return proper responses:

- ✅ `createInvestment()` - Returns `{ success: true, data: investment }`
- ✅ `updateInvestment()` - Returns `{ success: true, data: updatedInvestment }`
- ✅ `deleteInvestment()` - Returns `{ success: true }`
- ✅ `bulkDeleteInvestments()` - Returns `{ success: true, data: { deletedCount } }`
- ✅ `updateInvestmentGoal()` - Returns `{ success: true, data: updatedInvestment }`

## How It Works Now
1. User performs CRUD operation (e.g., delete investment)
2. Server action executes database operation
3. Cache invalidation: `revalidatePath()` called for affected pages
4. Server action returns proper success/error response
5. Client component receives response and handles UI updates
6. Cache invalidation ensures fresh data on next page load

## Benefits
- ✅ No more confusing `NEXT_REDIRECT` errors in console
- ✅ Proper error handling and success responses
- ✅ Client components can handle responses appropriately
- ✅ Cache invalidation still works via `revalidatePath()`
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (server actions handle data, client handles navigation)

## Client Component Compatibility
The existing client components already handle the responses correctly:

```typescript
const result = await deleteInvestment(selectedInvestment.id);

if (!result.success) {
  throw new Error(result.error || 'Failed to delete investment');
}

// Show success message
setStatusMessage({ type: 'success', text: 'Investment deleted successfully' });
```

The components rely on cache invalidation to refresh data, which continues to work as expected.
