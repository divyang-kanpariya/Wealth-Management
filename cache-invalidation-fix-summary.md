# Cache Invalidation Fix Summary

## Problem
After adding investments, the dashboard was not showing updated data immediately due to multiple layers of caching that weren't being properly invalidated.

## Root Cause
The main issue was that the `InvestmentInteractions` component was still using the old `fetch` API approach instead of server actions, which meant:
1. Cache invalidation wasn't being triggered properly
2. The component was using `window.location.reload()` instead of proper cache invalidation
3. Multiple cache layers weren't being coordinated

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Static Page Revalidation
**File**: `src/app/page.tsx`
- Removed `export const revalidate = 300` to rely on the more granular cache invalidation system
- The DashboardDataPreparator now handles its own caching and invalidation

### 2. Enhanced Cache Invalidation System
**File**: `src/lib/server/cache-invalidation.ts`
- Added more comprehensive cache tag invalidation
- Added invalidation for `dashboard-investments`, `dashboard-goals`, `dashboard-sips` tags
- Made cache invalidation more aggressive to ensure fresh data

### 3. Updated Dashboard Data Preparator
**File**: `src/lib/server/data-preparators/dashboard.ts`
- Reduced cache duration from 5 minutes to 2 minutes for more responsive updates
- Reduced unstable_cache revalidation from 5 minutes to 1 minute
- Changed cache invalidation to clear all entries instead of partial invalidation
- Added more comprehensive cache tags
- Added debugging information to track cache hits/misses

### 4. Fixed InvestmentInteractions Component
**File**: `src/components/investments/InvestmentInteractions.tsx`
- **Investment Creation/Update**: Replaced `fetch` calls with server actions (`createInvestment`, `updateInvestment`)
- **Investment Deletion**: Replaced `fetch` calls with server actions (`deleteInvestment`)
- **Bulk Deletion**: Replaced `fetch` calls with server actions (`bulkDeleteInvestments`)
- **Price Refresh**: Replaced `window.location.reload()` with dashboard refresh action
- **Import Complete**: Replaced `window.location.reload()` with dashboard refresh action
- **Removed all `window.location.reload()` calls** that were bypassing the cache system

### 5. Improved User Feedback
- Added proper success/error messages for all operations
- Status messages now show for 3-5 seconds with appropriate feedback
- Users get immediate feedback while cache invalidation happens in the background

## How It Works Now

1. **User adds/edits/deletes investment** → Server action is called
2. **Server action completes** → `CacheInvalidation.invalidateInvestments()` is called
3. **Cache invalidation triggers**:
   - Next.js cache tags are invalidated (`investments`, `dashboard`, `dashboard-investments`, etc.)
   - Page paths are revalidated (`/`, `/investments`)
   - In-memory cache is cleared
4. **Next page load/refresh** → Fresh data is fetched and cached
5. **User sees updated data** immediately on dashboard

## Benefits

- **Immediate Updates**: Dashboard now shows fresh data after any investment changes
- **Better Performance**: Proper cache invalidation instead of full page reloads
- **Improved UX**: Users get immediate feedback with success messages
- **More Reliable**: Server actions ensure proper cache coordination
- **Faster Response**: Reduced cache durations for more responsive updates

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Add a new investment
2. Navigate to dashboard (or refresh if already there)
3. The new investment should appear immediately
4. Use the refresh buttons on dashboard for manual cache clearing if needed

The dashboard now has both normal and force refresh buttons available for manual cache invalidation when needed.
