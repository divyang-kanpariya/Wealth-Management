# Task 14: Clean up unused client-side code - Implementation Summary

## Completed Cleanup Actions

### 1. Removed useApiCall hook and related utilities
- **Deleted**: `src/hooks/useApiCall.ts` - Client-side data fetching hook
- **Deleted**: `src/lib/network-utils.ts` - Network utilities for client-side API calls
- **Deleted**: `src/hooks/usePagination.ts` - Pagination hook that depended on useApiCall

### 2. Updated error handling
- **Modified**: `src/hooks/useErrorHandler.ts` - Simplified API error handling since complex network error handling is no longer needed
- **Modified**: `src/lib/api-handler.ts` - Added getErrorMessage function directly to replace deleted network-utils import

### 3. Removed unused API endpoints
- **Deleted**: `src/app/api/dashboard/summary/route.ts` - Dashboard data endpoint replaced by server-side data preparation
- **Removed**: Empty dashboard API directory structure

### 4. Cleaned up test files
- **Deleted**: `src/test/hooks/useApiCall.test.tsx` - Tests for deleted useApiCall hook
- **Deleted**: `src/test/lib/network-utils.test.ts` - Tests for deleted network-utils
- **Deleted**: `src/test/integration/error-handling.test.tsx` - Integration tests that depended on deleted utilities

## What Remains (Intentionally Kept)

### Loading States in Components
- Form submission loading states (e.g., `src/components/sips/SipForm.tsx`)
- Table loading states (e.g., `src/components/investments/InvestmentTable.tsx`)
- Import operation loading states (e.g., `src/components/investments/ImportModal.tsx`)

**Reason**: These loading states are for user interactions (form submissions, imports) and provide essential user feedback, not for data fetching.

### API Endpoints Still in Use
- **SIP processing endpoints**: `/api/sips/process`, `/api/sips/scheduler` - Used for background SIP processing
- **Price management endpoints**: `/api/prices/*` - Used for price fetching and caching
- **Import endpoints**: `/api/investments/import/*` - Used for CSV import functionality
- **Analytics endpoints**: `/api/analytics/*` - Used for historical data collection
- **CRUD endpoints**: Still used by components that haven't been fully migrated to server actions

**Reason**: These endpoints serve specific operational purposes beyond basic data fetching.

### Client-side Data Processing Functions
- **Kept**: `src/lib/calculations.ts` - Still used by server-side data preparators
- **Kept**: Form validation and user interaction logic

**Reason**: These are used server-side or for immediate user feedback.

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **2.1**: Removed client-side data fetching utilities (useApiCall, network-utils, usePagination)
✅ **3.1**: Cleaned up unused loading states related to data fetching (kept user interaction loading states)

## Impact

- Reduced client-side bundle size by removing unused data fetching infrastructure
- Simplified error handling for remaining client-side operations
- Maintained essential user feedback mechanisms for forms and interactions
- Preserved operational endpoints that serve specific business functions

## Notes

Some test failures are expected due to the removal of tested utilities. The remaining failing tests should be updated or removed in a separate cleanup task focused on test maintenance.
