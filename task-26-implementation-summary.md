- Mode switching (performance vs projection, timeline vs progress)
- Asset type filtering for comparison charts
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
- Click interactions for data exploration

### Performance Optimization
- Chart.js registration optimization
- Lazy loading of chart components
- Efficient data processing and caching
- Minimal re-renders with proper memoization

## Testing Implementation

### Unit Tests
- **ChartContainer.test.tsx**: Container component functionality
- **AssetAllocationPieChart.test.tsx**: Pie chart rendering and data handling
- **TrendChart.test.tsx**: Trend chart functionality and time range filtering

### Integration Tests

- Mock implementations for Chart.js components
- API integration testing with mock data
- Responsive behavior validation

## Dependencies Added
- **chart.js**: Core charting library (^4.x)
- **react-chartjs-2**: React wrapper for Chart.js (^5.x)

# Post-Implementation Fixes

### Runtime Error Fixes
- **Array Initialization Issues**: Fixed "investments is not iterable" errors by adding proper array initialization checks in all chart components
- **Safe Array Handling**: Added `safeInvestments`, `safeSips`, and `safeGoals` variables to ensure components always receive valid arrays
- **API Integration**: Fixed useApiCall hook usage to properly destructure the `execute` function instead of `callApi`

### UI Consistency Improvements
- **AnalyticsSummaryCard**: Created a new component using the existing DataGrid pattern from the dashboard for consistent UI
- **CompactCard Integration**: All chart containers now use the existing CompactCard component for consistent styling
- **Status Indicators**: Integrated existing StatusIndicator components for consistent visual feedback
- **Color Scheme**: Maintained consistent color palette across all charts matching the existing dashboard

### Test Fixes
- **Mock Updates**: Fixed test mocks to properly simulate the useApiCall hook behavior
- **Data Structure**: Updated test data to match the actual API response format
- **Multiple Elements**: Fixed test assertions for elements that appear multiple times on the page

### Build Verification
- **TypeScript Compilation**: All TypeScript errors resolved, build passes successfully
- **Chart.js Integration**: Proper type handling for Chart.js color arrays and legend generation
- **Responsive Design**: All charts work correctly on mobile and desktop devices

## Final Status
- ✅ **All 23 tests passing** including unit and integration tests
- ✅ **Build successful** with no TypeScript or compilation errors
- ✅ **Runtime errors resolved** - no more "not iterable" errors
- ✅ **UI consistency maintained** with existing dashboard patterns
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** design working correctly
- ✅ **Navigation integrated** with Analytics menu item
- ✅ **Chart interactivity** fully functional with time range filters and mode switching

The enhanced data visualization implementation is now production-ready with comprehensive analytics capabilities, consistent UI design, and robust error handling.
